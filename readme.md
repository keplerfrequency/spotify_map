## FAQ

### What does this site do?
This site allows you to navigate Spotify playlists with a map. By clicking on the countries, you can see playlists from that country. When you click on the playlist, it will then be loaded into the player element at the bottom, and you can listen to those tracks.

### What countries are currently supported by the website?
Currently, only European countries you can hover over are supported. This started as a personal project to hear more music from countries in Europe. There are currently no plans to expand to other continents. If you would like other continents, send me an email or leave a comment on GitHub (see link below).

### Why does country X have playlists from country Y?
Spotify search does this sometimes. Searching for playlists from country X can sometimes give results from adjacent countries or countries with similar-sounding names.

### How often are the playlists updated?
The playlists are updated once every few months by performing new searches via the Spotify API.

### How can I save, follow, or share a playlist?
Currently, there is no way to do so. You will have to open the playlist in Spotify by clicking on the name of the playlist in the player.

### What is the purpose of this site?
Hobby project. If you enjoy the project, use the donation link to donate to Ukraine.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't find the country I'm looking for.
The country should be clickable; otherwise, it is currently not supported.

### The website is not loading properly.
Try using either Chrome or Mozilla. These are the most tested browsers.

### The website looks bad on my phone.
Do not use this website on a mobile device. There is only desktop support.

### I'm having trouble creating an account/playing the music to the end.
You will need a Spotify account to play the music fully. You should be able to log in when opening the page.
